# lcpp_apoc_map (WIP!)
A series of custom YMAPs for the Liberty City Preservation Project mod (For FiveM version).

## WIP Features
- **Optimized and Custom YMAPs**: Built strategically; wrecked vehicles, overgrown vegetation, unique POI scenes, and safe zones are all separated so you can decide what to use.
- **Interesting Safe Zones**: Designed for use with survival scripts (e.g., clothing, food, and medical POIs within the safe zone).
- **Fun POIs**: Created to encourage exploration.
- **Apocalyptic Building Access**: Provides access to higher buildings for base building.
