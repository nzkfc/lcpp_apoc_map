# lcpp_apoc_map (WIP!)
A series of custom YMAPs for the Liberty City Preservation Project mod (For FiveM version).

## WIP Features
- **Optimized and Custom YMAPs**: Built strategically; wrecked vehicles, overgrown vegetation, unique POI scenes, and safe zones are all separated so you can decide what to use.
- **Interesting Safe Zones**: Designed for use with survival scripts (e.g., clothing, food, and medical POIs within the safe zone).
- **Fun POIs**: Created to encourage exploration.
- **Apocalyptic Building Access**: Provides access to higher buildings for base building.

**Release ETA:**  
Vehicles/Vegetation will be the first release for Algonquin. Temporary files to block off the bridges will also be included, allowing servers to get up and running. Each area will be released one by one for vehicles/vegetation as updates, giving server owners additional land to expand into while keeping content fresh.
